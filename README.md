# FLL Code Repository

This repository is used to store and organize the code we created and used throughout this year's **FIRST LEGO League (FLL)** season.  
Our goal is to keep all our programs in one place so our team can track progress, review past work, and collaborate more easily.

Feel free to add:
- Robot programs(Spike Prime)
- Test scripts
- Notes or documentation about how our code works
- Any improvements or alternate versions of missions

Let’s keep the repository organized and clearly labeled so everyone on the team can use it effectively!
